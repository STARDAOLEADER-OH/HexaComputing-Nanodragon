# HexaComputing Nanodragon

This project is a submodule of STARDAO, dedicated to research and prototyping of 6-based logic carbon nanotube processors for 6G-era chips and computation systems.

## Overview

HexaComputing Nanodragon integrates structural theory and novel physical-electronic hybrid computation architecture. Based on the papers:

1. "六进制碳纳米管运算结构及其在6G芯片中的潜力分析"
2. "六进制芯片架构中的物理逻辑映射与结构论衍生"

We define a new generation of carbon nanotube processors capable of hexadecimal-based logic operations with ultra-low power consumption and multi-dimensional stability.
