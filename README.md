# HexaComputing Nanodragon

A structural proposal for 6-based computing using carbon nanotubes, designed for ultra-efficient logic gate computation in future 6G nanotech chips.

This repository contains the conceptual framework, system architecture, and DAO governance rules for a next-generation base-6 computation model powered by carbon nanotube semiconductors.

## 🔍 Project Vision
HexaComputing Nanodragon explores an alternative to binary logic by introducing **base-6 logic gate systems**, enabling:
- Higher information density per logic gate
- Reduced energy consumption in transistor switching
- Integration with decentralized modular governance via DAO architecture

## 🧠 Key Features
- **Carbon Nanotube Logic Design**: Scalable, energy-efficient logic structure for nanoscale processors.
- **Base-6 Arithmetic Core**: Beyond binary and ternary, aiming at optimal signal/noise and transistor switching thresholds.
- **DAO-based Modular Governance**: Built-in rules for collaborative development, open-source evolution, and flexible modular control.
