# DAO Constitution: HexaComputing Nanodragon

## 1. Objective

To establish a decentralized governance and funding framework for developing 6-based logic carbon nanotube processors.

## 2. Core Rules

- Token: `STAR-HX` (non-tradable, purpose-specific governance token)
- Governance:
  - Founder has 20% initial control, automatically diluted every 3 months
  - Researchers, contributors, and engineers earn tokens via contribution
- Critical rules locked by smart contract; flexible rules amendable by 2/3 majority

## 3. Research Phases

- Phase I: Physical logic modeling
- Phase II: Nano-fabrication simulation
- Phase III: Test chip MVP
- Phase IV: Publication & patent-free release
